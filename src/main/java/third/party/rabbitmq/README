Make Sure you have RabbitMQ server running on your local machine with default configuration

Sender.java   - produces a message "Hello World!" and sends it to the RabbitMQ which will be queued into the "hello" queue
Receiver.java - waits and consumes a message within the "hello" queue and prints out the message "Hello World!"
